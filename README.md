# Messenger Utility Bot

This is a messenger bot built using ExpressJS.

## Development Instructions

1. Fork the project. Go to glitch.com, create a new project, under tools, click on import from github and type in the forked repo. We will do most of our development on glitch.com because the Messenger platform requires the bot to be running in the cloud on a https server.
2. Once step 1 is done, head over to developers.facebook.com, create a new app, facebook page and set up your bot as per these instructions https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/app-setup. Note this setup is a one time setup and you won't need to repeat it.
3. Once you get your Page Access Token, create a .env file and paste in the token as shown in the `.env.example` file. 
4. After done with the feature you're building, you can use glitch's export to github feature that will push to a github glitch branch that you can use to PR against the master branch on this repo.
